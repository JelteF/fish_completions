Fish Completions
================

These are completions I have written for utilities I found fish its own
completion lacking. These are mostly utilities used by Gentoo.  Currently I have
written completions for these commandline tools:
 - rc-service
 - rc-update
 - eselect


### Installation
For the completions of eselect to work the patch described in this
[post](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=490882#c1) has to be applied.
